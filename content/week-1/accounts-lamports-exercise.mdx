This exercise helps you explore the basics of Solana's account system and lamports. Youâ€™ll create wallets, transfer funds, examine how rent works, and inspect the structure of an account.

These operations are foundational for interacting with on-chain programs.

You donâ€™t need to understand everything about programs yet. This is all about getting comfortable with how accounts and transfers work at the CLI level.

## Step-by-Step Exercise

<Steps>
<Step>
### Step 1: Create Two Wallets

Generate two keypairs and save them as separate files.

```bash
solana-keygen new --outfile wallet1.json
solana-keygen new --outfile wallet2.json
````

</Step>

<Step>

### Step 2: Check Wallet Balances

Use the `--keypair` flag to check balances of both wallets.

```bash
solana balance --keypair wallet1.json
solana balance --keypair wallet2.json
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Step 3: Airdrop to Wallet 1

Request 2 SOL to the first wallet on devnet.

```bash
solana airdrop 2 --keypair wallet1.json
solana balance --keypair wallet1.json
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Step 4: Transfer Lamports to Wallet 2

Send 0.01 SOL (10,000,000 lamports) to wallet2 using its public key.

```bash
solana transfer ADDRESS_2 10000000 --from wallet1.json --allow-unfunded-recipient
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Step 5: Confirm Transfer

Verify that the balances are updated as expected.

```bash
solana balance --keypair wallet1.json
solana balance --keypair wallet2.json
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Step 6: Inspect Account Layout

Use the `solana account` command to see internal fields like owner, lamports, and rent status.

```bash
solana account ADDRESS_2
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Rent and Minimum Balance

Accounts on Solana either:

  * Stay rent-exempt by holding a minimum balance
  * Or lose balance over time through rent fees

To check the rent-exempt threshold for an empty account:

```bash
solana rent 0
```

<Callout type="tip">
For most accounts used by smart contracts, it is best to make them rent-exempt to avoid unexpected deletion.
</Callout>

-----

## Additional Practice Ideas

  * Try sending lamports without the `--allow-unfunded-recipient` flag
  * Airdrop to wallet2 directly and then inspect its account layout
  * Run `solana account` on a known public account (e.g. SPL Token Mint) and study the fields

<Callout type="info">
Feel free to explore variations. Small tweaks help you deeply understand Solanaâ€™s account system.
</Callout>

## Common Pitfalls

<Callout type="warn">
**Forgetting `--keypair`**
The CLI will default to the wallet in `~/.config/solana/id.json` if no keypair is provided, which can lead to using the wrong wallet.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
**Mixing up SOL and lamports**
Solana CLI expects lamports in most commands. 1 SOL = 1,000,000,000 lamports.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
**Transfer fails without `--allow-unfunded-recipient`**
If the receiving account has never existed before, Solana requires this flag to cover rent and create the account.
</Callout>

## Summary

In this exercise, you:

  * Created two Solana wallets
  * Funded one and transferred lamports to the other
  * Used CLI commands to inspect balances and accounts
  * Learned how rent and lamport units affect account health

These are the basic CLI skills every Solana developer should know before deploying or interacting with smart contracts.
