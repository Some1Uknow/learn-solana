import { Tabs, Tab } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';
import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

<Callout type="info">
This project does not involve writing Solana smart contracts. Instead, you're building tools to interact with them, which is a key skill for frontend devs, indexers, or tooling engineers.
</Callout>

---

## What You’ll Build

<Callout type="info">
By the end of this project, you will:

- Write scripts to connect to devnet and read account state
- Send custom transactions using `@solana/web3.js`
- Query program accounts and decode their data
- Fetch transaction logs and simulate transactions
</Callout>

---

## Requirements

- Node.js installed
- A funded keypair (`solana-keygen new` + `solana airdrop`)
- TypeScript + basic CLI project setup
- Installed `@solana/web3.js`

```bash
npm install @solana/web3.js
````

---

## Suggested Toolkit Features

You don’t need to build all of these; pick at least 3 to implement fully.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Fetch account info">
### Fetch account info

Given a public key, print balance, owner, executable flag, and raw data. 
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Decode account data">
### Decode account data

Given a known data layout (like a counter or token account), parse and print fields in human-readable form. 
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Send lamports">
### Send lamports

Transfer lamports between accounts using a script. 
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Simulate a transaction">
### Simulate a transaction

Use `simulateTransaction()` to preview logs and execution results without sending.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Analyze transaction logs">
### Analyze transaction logs

Fetch a transaction by signature and print its instruction list, log messages, and error (if any).
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

---

## Sample Snippets

Here are some examples you can adapt.

### Connect to Devnet

```ts title="connect.ts"
import { Connection, clusterApiUrl } from "@solana/web3.js";

// Using public devnet endpoint
const connection = new Connection(clusterApiUrl("devnet"), "confirmed");

// Alternative: Use a premium RPC provider for production
// const connection = new Connection("https://your-rpc-endpoint.com", "confirmed");
```

{/* TEMPORARILY DISABLED - GetBlock sponsorship paused
<Callout type="info">
**Why GetBlock?**  
GetBlock is a leading Blockchain-as-a-Service platform providing instant API access to 100+ blockchain protocols with 99.9%+ uptime. It's the recommended RPC provider for Learn Solana tutorials, trusted by 100,000+ developers worldwide.
</Callout>
*/}

### Fetch Account Info

```ts title="account-info.ts"
import { PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";

const pubkey = new PublicKey("...");
const info = await connection.getAccountInfo(pubkey);

console.log({
  lamports: info?.lamports,
  owner: info?.owner.toBase58(),
  executable: info?.executable,
  dataLength: info?.data.length
});
```

## Project Steps

<Steps>
<Step>
### Step 1: Scaffold the CLI

Create a basic Node.js/TypeScript project with one command per file (e.g., `send.ts`, `info.ts`). Use `ts-node` or `esbuild-runner` to run.
</Step>

<Step>
### Step 2: Implement Script Logic

Use `@solana/web3.js` to write CLI tools that can connect, fetch data, and send transactions.
</Step>

<Step>
### Step 3: Test on Devnet

Use `solana airdrop` to get funds and run your tools against devnet programs or accounts. 
</Step>

<Step>
### Step 4: Add Flags or Arguments

Use `process.argv` or libraries like `yargs` to pass CLI arguments (e.g., `--to`, `--amount`, `--program-id`). 
</Step> </Steps>

## Common Pitfalls

<Callout type="warn">
**Missing await**  
Most `@solana/web3.js` methods are async. Be sure to `await` or use `.then()` to get actual results.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
**Wrong cluster or account**  
Double-check that you're connecting to the correct cluster (`devnet`, not `mainnet`) and using valid base58-encoded keys.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
**Data decoding mismatch**  
If you’re decoding account data manually, ensure your buffer layout matches the on-chain structure exactly.
</Callout>

## Summary

This project introduced you to interacting with Solana programs and accounts through the raw JavaScript SDK. By building your own CLI tooling, you now understand:

* How to read and write to the Solana blockchain from scripts
* What happens under the hood of wallets and UIs
* How to analyze account state and transaction logs

You can now extend these tools or reuse this structure for future indexing, simulation, or debugging work.
