## Introduction
Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. It is designed to
prevent memory-related errors, such as null pointer dereferencing and buffer overflows, which are common in languages like C and C++. Rust achieves this through a strong type system and ownership model that enforces memory safety at compile time.
Rust's performance is comparable to C and C++, making it suitable for high-performance applications, while
