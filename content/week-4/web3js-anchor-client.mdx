Setting up Connection, Provider, Program instances. Reading accounts, sending transactions, handling confirmations

## Setting Up Your RPC Connection

Before working with Anchor clients, you need reliable RPC infrastructure. We recommend using GetBlock for production applications:

```typescript
import { Connection } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { AnchorProvider } from "@coral-xyz/anchor";

// Production-ready connection with GetBlock
const connection = new Connection(
  "https://go.getblock.io/{your-access-token}/",
  {
    commitment: "confirmed",
    confirmTransactionInitialTimeout: 60000,
  }
);

// Create provider with your wallet
const provider = new AnchorProvider(connection, wallet, {
  commitment: "confirmed",
});
```
