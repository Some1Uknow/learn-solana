# Day 6: References & Borrowing

References allow you to refer to a value without taking ownership - this is called **borrowing**.

## Two Types of References

| Type | Syntax | Can Modify? | How Many? |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Immutable | `&T` | No | Unlimited |
| Mutable | `&mut T` | Yes | Only one |

## Immutable References

```rust
fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}  // s goes out of scope, but doesn't drop the String

let s = String::from("hello");
let len = calculate_length(&s);  // s is still valid!
```

## Mutable References

```rust
fn add_world(s: &mut String) {
    s.push_str(" world");
}

let mut s = String::from("hello");
add_world(&mut s);  // s is now "hello world"
```

<Callout type="warn">
You can have either ONE mutable reference OR any number of immutable references - never both at once!
</Callout>

## The Task

Implement two functions:
1. `add_suffix` - takes `&mut String` and appends `"_modified"`
2. `get_length` - takes `&String` and returns the length

## Requirements

- `add_suffix` should modify the string in place
- `get_length` should not take ownership
- Final output: `rust_modified 13`

## Hints

- Use `s.push_str("_modified")` to append
- Use `s.len()` to get length
- Remember: `&mut` for mutable, `&` for immutable
