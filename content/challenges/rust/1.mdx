# Day 1: Factorial

Write a function `factorial(n)` that returns $n!$ for a non-negative integer `n`.

<Callout>
Aim for clarity and safety. Consider edge cases like `n = 0`. Prefer an iterative solution for now.
</Callout>

## Requirements

- Return `1` for `n = 0`.
- Use a type large enough for small `n` (e.g., `u128`).
- Keep allocations minimal.

## Example

```
Input:  n = 3
Output: 6
Reason: 3! = 6
```

## Notes

- Rust ownership and borrowing rules will guide the design.
- Prefer iterators and functional transforms where clear.
- Keep allocations minimal; think like a systems dev.
