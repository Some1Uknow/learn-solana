# Day 1: Hello Rust

Welcome to your Rust journey! Today we'll write our first Rust program and learn the fundamentals.

<Callout type="info">
Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. It's the language of choice for Solana programs!
</Callout>

## What You'll Learn

- Declaring variables with `let`
- Basic string types
- The `println!` macro for output
- String interpolation with `{}`

## The Task

Create a variable called `name` with the value `"Rustacean"` and print a greeting message.

## Key Concepts

### Variables

In Rust, variables are declared with `let`:

```rust
let x = 5;           // immutable by default
let mut y = 10;      // mutable with 'mut'
```

### The println! Macro

Use `println!` to print to the console:

```rust
let name = "World";
println!("Hello, {}!", name);  // Output: Hello, World!
```

## Requirements

- Create a variable `name` with the value `"Rustacean"`
- Print exactly: `Hello, Rustacean! Welcome to Rust.`

## Hints

<Callout type="warn">
Make sure your output matches exactly - including punctuation and spacing!
</Callout>

- Use `let` to declare the variable
- Use `println!` with `{}` for interpolation
- The string must be a `&str` literal (in quotes)
