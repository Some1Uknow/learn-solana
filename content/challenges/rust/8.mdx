# Day 8: Structs

Structs let you create custom types by grouping related data together.

## Defining a Struct

```rust
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    active: bool,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}
```

## Creating Instances

```rust
let user = User {
    username: String::from("alice"),
    email: String::from("alice@example.com"),
    active: true,
    sign_in_count: 1,
};
```

## Field Init Shorthand

When variable names match field names:

```rust
fn create_user(username: String, email: String) -> User {
    User {
        username,  // same as username: username
        email,     // same as email: email
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}
```

In Solana, program accounts are modeled as structs with careful memory layouts!
</Callout>

## The Task

1. Define a `User` struct with `name: String` and `age: u32`
2. Implement `create_user` to create a User instance
3. Implement `greet` to return a greeting string

## Requirements

- Struct must have fields `name` and `age`
- `greet` returns: `"Hi, I'm {name} and I'm {age} years old"`
- Test creates `User("Alice", 30)`

## Hints

- Use `String::from(name)` or `name.to_string()` to convert `&str` to `String`
- Use `format!()` macro to build the greeting string:
  ```rust
  format!("Hi, I'm {} and I'm {} years old", user.name, user.age)
  ```
