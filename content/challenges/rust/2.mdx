# Day 2: Fibonacci

Implement `fib(n)` that returns the nth Fibonacci number.

## Requirements

- Use an iterative approach.
- Avoid unnecessary allocations.
- Choose an appropriate integer type (e.g., `u64`).

## Example

```
Input:  n = 10
Output: 55
```

## Notes

- This is a warm-up for algorithmic thinking.
- Later weâ€™ll look at performance and benchmarking.
