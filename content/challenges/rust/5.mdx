# Day 5: Ownership Basics

Ownership is Rust's most unique feature and enables memory safety without garbage collection.

<Callout type="warn">
This concept is **crucial** for Solana development! Account data ownership and borrowing follow similar principles.
</Callout>

## The Three Rules of Ownership

1. Each value has an **owner**
2. There can only be **one owner** at a time
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is **dropped**

## Move Semantics

When you assign a `String` to another variable, ownership **moves**:

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;  // s1 is now invalid!
// println!("{}", s1);  // ERROR: s1 was moved
```

## Clone: Deep Copy

Use `.clone()` to create a deep copy:

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();  // Both s1 and s2 are valid
```

## The Task

The provided code has an ownership error. The `take_ownership` function takes ownership of the String, so the second call fails.

Fix it so both calls work and the output is `18` (9 + 9).

## Requirements

- Don't change the `take_ownership` function signature
- Make both function calls work
- Output should be `18`

## Hints

- You need to clone the string before the first call
- Or restructure to create two separate strings
- `message.clone()` creates a copy
