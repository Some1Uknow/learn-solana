## What You'll Learn Today

<Callout type="info">
By the end of Day 1, you'll be able to:

- Install and configure the Rust toolchain
- Set up VS Code with Rust-analyzer for optimal development
- Write and run basic Rust programs
- Understand variables, mutability, and basic data types
- Create functions with parameters and return values
- Use control flow constructs (if/else, loops)
- Distinguish between expressions and statements
</Callout>

---

## Getting Started with Rust

### Installing the Rust Toolchain

Rust comes with an excellent installer called `rustup` that manages your Rust installation and keeps it up to date.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Step 1: Install Rustup

Visit [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

**For Windows:**
Download and run `rustup-init.exe`

**For macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Step 2: Verify Installation

Open a new terminal and verify your installation:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

You should see version information for both the Rust compiler (`rustc`) and Cargo (Rust's package manager).
</Step>

<Step>
### Step 3: Update Your Toolchain

Keep your Rust installation up to date:

```bash
rustup update
```
</Step>
</Steps>

### Understanding the Rust Ecosystem

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="rustc - The Rust Compiler">
### rustc - The Rust Compiler

`rustc` is the core Rust compiler. It transforms your Rust source code into executable binaries. While you can use it directly, most developers use Cargo instead.

```bash
# Compile a single file
rustc main.rs
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cargo - The Package Manager">
### Cargo - The Package Manager

Cargo is Rust's build tool and package manager. It handles:
- Creating new projects
- Managing dependencies
- Building and running your code
- Running tests
- Publishing packages

```bash
# Create a new project
cargo new my_project
cd my_project

# Build your project
cargo build

# Run your project
cargo run
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="rustup - The Toolchain Manager">
### rustup - The Toolchain Manager

`rustup` manages your Rust installations. It can install multiple versions of Rust and switch between them as needed.

```bash
# List installed toolchains
rustup show

# Install a specific version
rustup install stable
rustup install nightly

# Set default toolchain
rustup default stable
```
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

---

## Setting Up VS Code

VS Code with the Rust-analyzer extension provides an excellent Rust development experience.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Step 1: Install VS Code

Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
</Step>

<Step>
### Step 2: Install Rust-analyzer Extension

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X)
3. Search for "rust-analyzer"
4. Install the official rust-analyzer extension
</Step>

<Step>
### Step 3: Optional Extensions

Consider these additional extensions for a better experience:
- **Error Lens**: Shows errors inline
- **Better TOML**: For Cargo.toml syntax highlighting
- **CodeLLDB**: For debugging support
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
**Pro Tip**: Rust-analyzer provides incredible features like inline type hints, error diagnostics, and code completion. Let it guide your learning!
</Callout>

## Your First Rust Program

Let's start with the traditional "Hello, World!" program and understand what makes it special in Rust.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Step 1: Create a New Project

```bash
cargo new hello_rust
cd hello_rust
```

This creates a new directory with:
- `Cargo.toml`: Project configuration
- `src/main.rs`: Your main source file
</Step>

<Step>
### Step 2: Examine the Generated Code

Open `src/main.rs`:

```rust title="src/main.rs"
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Let's break this down:
- `fn main()`: Defines the main function (entry point)
- `println!`: A macro (note the `!`) that prints to console
- Statements end with semicolons
</Step>

<Step>
### Step 3: Run Your Program

```bash
cargo run
```

You should see:
```
   Compiling hello_rust v0.1.0 (/path/to/hello_rust)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.50s
     Running `target/debug/hello_rust`
Hello, world!
```
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
**Understanding macros**: `println!` is a macro, not a function. Macros in Rust are indicated by the `!` and are expanded at compile time. They're more powerful than functions but we'll cover them in detail later.
</Callout>

## Variables and Mutability

One of Rust's core principles is that variables are **immutable by default**. This prevents many common programming errors.

<Mermaid 
  chart="
    graph TD
      A[let x = 5] --> B{Immutable by default}
      B --> C[✅ Can read value]
      B --> D[❌ Cannot change value]
      
      E[let mut y = 5] --> F{Explicitly mutable}
      F --> G[✅ Can read value]
      F --> H[✅ Can change value]
      F --> I[y = 10 // Valid]
      
      J[const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000] --> K{Compile-time constant}
      K --> L[✅ Always immutable]
      K --> M[✅ Known at compile time]
      K --> N[✅ Can use in any scope]
      
      style A fill:#e1f5fe
      style E fill:#f3e5f5
      style J fill:#e8f5e8
      style D fill:#ffebee
      style C fill:#e8f5e8
      style G fill:#e8f5e8
      style H fill:#e8f5e8"
/>

### Basic Variables

```rust title="variables.rs"
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    
    // This would cause a compile error:
    // x = 6; // Cannot assign twice to immutable variable
}
```

### Mutable Variables

To change a variable's value, you must explicitly make it mutable:

```rust title="mutable.rs"
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    
    x = 6; // This works because x is mutable
    println!("The value of x is now: {}", x);
}
```

### Constants vs Variables

<Tabs items={['Variables (let)', 'Constants (const)']}>
<Tab value="Variables (let)">
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;          // Immutable by default
    let mut y = 10;     // Explicitly mutable
    
    // Can be shadowed (redeclared)
    let x = x + 1;      // Creates new variable
    let x = x * 2;      // x is now 12
    
    println!("x: {}, y: {}", x, y);
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Constants (const)">
```rust
// Constants are always immutable and must have type annotations
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;

fn main() {
    println!("Three hours in seconds: {}", THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS);
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="tip">
**Naming Convention**: Constants use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`, while variables use `snake_case`.
</Callout>

---

## Basic Data Types

Rust is a statically typed language, meaning all variable types must be known at compile time.

### Scalar Types

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Integer Types">
### Integer Types

Rust has several integer types based on size and signedness:

```rust title="integers.rs"
fn main() {
    let a: i8 = -128;      // 8-bit signed (-128 to 127)
    let b: u8 = 255;       // 8-bit unsigned (0 to 255)
    let c: i32 = -50_000;  // 32-bit signed (default integer type)
    let d: u64 = 1_000_000; // 64-bit unsigned
    
    // Type inference - Rust can often determine types
    let guess = 42;        // defaults to i32
    
    println!("a: {}, b: {}, c: {}, d: {}, guess: {}", a, b, c, d, guess);
}
```

**Common integer types:**
- `i32` / `u32`: Most common, good default choice
- `i64` / `u64`: For larger numbers
- `usize` / `isize`: For indexing and memory addresses
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Floating-Point Types">
### Floating-Point Types

```rust title="floats.rs"
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0;        // f64 by default
    let y: f32 = 3.0;   // f32 (single precision)
    
    // Mathematical operations
    let sum = x + y as f64;  // Type casting required
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;
    let product = 4.0 * 30.0;
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    
    println!("sum: {}, difference: {}, product: {}, quotient: {}", 
             sum, difference, product, quotient);
}
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Boolean Type">
### Boolean Type

```rust title="booleans.rs"
fn main() {
    let t = true;
    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
    
    // Boolean operations
    let is_morning = true;
    let is_weekday = false;
    let go_to_work = is_morning && is_weekday;
    
    println!("Go to work: {}", go_to_work);
}
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Character Type">
### Character Type

```rust title="characters.rs"
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = 'ℤ';  // Unicode support
    let heart_eyed_cat = '😻';
    
    println!("Characters: {}, {}, {}", c, z, heart_eyed_cat);
}
```

**Note**: `char` literals use single quotes and represent Unicode scalar values.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

### Type Annotations and Inference

<Tabs items={['Type Inference', 'Explicit Annotations']}>
<Tab value="Type Inference">
```rust
fn main() {
    // Rust can infer types from context
    let mut guess = String::new();  // String type inferred
    
    let x = 5;          // i32 inferred
    let y = 2.5;        // f64 inferred
    let is_active = true; // bool inferred
    
    // Sometimes context helps with inference
    let numbers: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();  // Vector of i32s
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Explicit Annotations">
```rust
fn main() {
    // Explicit type annotations
    let x: i64 = 5;
    let y: f32 = 2.5;
    let name: String = String::from("Rust");
    
    // Sometimes required when multiple types are possible
    let parsed: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

---

## Functions and Control Flow

### Function Syntax

Functions in Rust are defined with the `fn` keyword:

```rust title="functions.rs"
fn main() {
    println!("Hello from main!");
    
    greet_user("Alice");
    
    let result = add_numbers(5, 3);
    println!("5 + 3 = {}", result);
    
    let (sum, product) = calculate(4, 6);
    println!("Sum: {}, Product: {}", sum, product);
}

// Function with parameters
fn greet_user(name: &str) {
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);
}

// Function with return value
fn add_numbers(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b  // No semicolon = return value (expression)
}

// Function returning multiple values (tuple)
fn calculate(x: i32, y: i32) -> (i32, i32) {
    (x + y, x * y)
}
```

<Callout type="info">
**Expressions vs Statements**: 
- **Expressions** evaluate to a value (no semicolon at end)
- **Statements** perform an action (end with semicolon)
- Functions return the last expression in their body
</Callout>

### Control Flow

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="if/else Conditionals">
### if/else Conditionals

```rust title="conditionals.rs"
fn main() {
    let number = 6;
    
    // Basic if/else
    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
    
    // if as an expression
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };
    println!("The value of number is: {}", number);
}
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Loop Constructs">
### Loop Constructs

Rust has three kinds of loops: `loop`, `while`, and `for`.

```rust title="loops.rs"
fn main() {
    // Infinite loop with break
    let mut counter = 0;
    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;
        
        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;  // Return value from loop
        }
    };
    println!("The result is {}", result);
    
    // While loop
    let mut number = 3;
    while number != 0 {
        println!("{}!", number);
        number -= 1;
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
    
    // For loop with range
    for number in 1..4 {  // 1, 2, 3 (4 is excluded)
        println!("{}!", number);
    }
    
    // For loop with array
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    for element in a {
        println!("the value is: {}", element);
    }
    
    // For loop with index
    for (index, value) in a.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("Index {}: {}", index, value);
    }
}
```
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Comments and Documentation

Good documentation is crucial for any codebase, especially in blockchain development where security and clarity are paramount.

<Tabs items={['Regular Comments', 'Documentation Comments']}>
<Tab value="Regular Comments">
```rust
fn main() {
    // This is a line comment
    let x = 5; // Comments can be at the end of lines
    
    /*
     * This is a block comment
     * spanning multiple lines
     */
    let y = 10;
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Documentation Comments">
```rust
/// This function adds two numbers together

## Practical Example: Blockchain Basics

Let's put together what we've learned by creating a simple program that demonstrates blockchain concepts:

```rust title="blockchain_basics.rs"
fn main() {
    println!("=== Simple Blockchain Demo ===");
    
    // Initialize genesis block
    let genesis_balance = 1_000_000; // 1 million tokens
    let mut current_balance = genesis_balance;
    
    println!("Genesis block created with {} tokens", genesis_balance);
    
    // Simulate some transactions
    let transactions = [
        ("Alice", 50_000),
        ("Bob", 25_000),
        ("Charlie", 75_000),
    ];
    
    for (recipient, amount) in transactions {
        if current_balance >= amount {
            current_balance -= amount;
            println!("✅ Sent {} tokens to {} (Remaining: {})", 
                     amount, recipient, current_balance);
        } else {
            println!("❌ Insufficient funds to send {} tokens to {}", 
                     amount, recipient);
        }
    }
    
    // Calculate final statistics
    let total_sent = genesis_balance - current_balance;
    let transaction_count = transactions.len();
    
    print_summary(total_sent, current_balance, transaction_count);
}

/// Prints a summary of blockchain transactions
fn print_summary(total_sent: u64, remaining: u64, tx_count: usize) {
    println!("\n=== Transaction Summary ===");
    println!("Total transactions: {}", tx_count);
    println!("Total tokens sent: {}", total_sent);
    println!("Remaining balance: {}", remaining);
    
    let average_tx = if tx_count > 0 {
        total_sent / tx_count as u64
    } else {
        0
    };
    println!("Average transaction size: {}", average_tx);
}
```

## Common Pitfalls for Day 1

<Callout type="warn">
**Forgetting Mutability**
```rust
let x = 5;
x = 6; // ❌ Error: cannot assign twice to immutable variable

let mut x = 5;
x = 6; // ✅ Works because x is mutable
```
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
**Mixing Statement and Expression Syntax**
```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b;  // ❌ Error: semicolon makes this a statement, not expression
}

fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b   // ✅ Expression returns the value
}
```
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
**Type Mismatches**
```rust
let x: i32 = 5;
let y: i64 = x; // ❌ Error: type mismatch

let x: i32 = 5;
let y: i64 = x as i64; // ✅ Explicit type conversion
```
</Callout>

## Summary

Congratulations! You've completed Day 1 of your Rust journey. Today you:

- ✅ Set up a complete Rust development environment
- ✅ Learned about variables, mutability, and constants
- ✅ Explored Rust's basic data types
- ✅ Understood functions and control flow
- ✅ Practiced with a blockchain-themed example

**Key Takeaways:**
- Rust variables are immutable by default (use `mut` for mutability)
- Functions can return values using expressions (no semicolon)
- Type safety is enforced at compile time
- Documentation is built into the language

**Tomorrow Preview:** Day 2 will introduce Rust's most distinctive feature - the ownership system. This is what makes Rust memory-safe without garbage collection, and it's crucial for understanding how to write efficient Solana programs.
